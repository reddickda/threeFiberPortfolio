# Personal react-three-fiber portfolio

The purpose of this project is to be my personal portfolio where I can add any 3D design/scenes I like using routing

## The Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project uses React with [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and other libraries related to [three.js](https://threejs.org/) in tandem with raw html and css

### `Routing technique for more scenes`
I use components as my 3D "scenes" and use react routing to be able to navigate betweeen all of the 3D work. I think its neat.

If there is a desire, I will release a template version of this project so that others can just clone this repo and create their own cool 3D portfolio sites.

**I will be posting issues, bugs, and defects that I run into. Feel free to submit a PR or call anything else wrong to me. Or just any improvements you notice!**
**[this](https://discoverthreejs.com/) was a wonderful book that is online and free for learning the basics of three.js that I recommend anyone interested to read!**

Thanks,
DR
